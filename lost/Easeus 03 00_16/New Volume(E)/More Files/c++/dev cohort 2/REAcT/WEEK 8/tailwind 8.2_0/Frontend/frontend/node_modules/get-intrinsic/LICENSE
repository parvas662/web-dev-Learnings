### fromSource(source)

Finds last sourcemap comment in file and returns source map converter or returns `null` if no source map comment was found.

### fromMapFileSource(source, readMap)

Finds last sourcemap comment in file and returns source map converter or returns `null` if no source map comment was found.

`readMap` must be a function which receives the source map filename and returns either a String or Buffer of the source map (if read synchronously), or a `Promise` containing a String or Buffer of the source map (if read asynchronously).

If `readMap` doesn't return a `Promise`, `fromMapFileSource` will return a source map converter synchronously.

If `readMap` returns a `Promise`, `fromMapFileSource` will also return `Promise`. The `Promise` will be either resolved with the source map converter or rejected with an error.

### toObject()

Returns a copy of the underlying source map.

### toJSON([space])

Converts source map to json
