Get the ArrayBuffer out of a TypedArray, robustly.

This will work in node <= 0.10 and < 0.11.4, where there's no prototype accessor, only a nonconfigurable own property.
It will also work in modern engines where `TypedArray.prototype.buffer` has been deleted after this module has loaded.

## Example

```js
const typedArrayBuffer = require('typed-array-buffer');
const assert = require('assert');

const arr = new Uint8Array(0);
assert.equal(arr.buffer, typedArrayBuffer(arr));
```

## Tests
Simply clone the repo, `npm install`, and run `npm test`
