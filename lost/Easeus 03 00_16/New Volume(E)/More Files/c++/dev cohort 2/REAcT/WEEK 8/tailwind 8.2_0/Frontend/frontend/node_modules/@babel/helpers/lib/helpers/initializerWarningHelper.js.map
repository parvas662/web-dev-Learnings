e PI with fraction.js on my [blog](http://www.xarg.org/2014/03/precise-calculations-in-javascript/) (Still not the best idea to approximate irrational numbers, but it illustrates the capabilities of Fraction.js perfectly).


Get the exact fractional part of a number
---
```javascript
var f = new Fraction("-6.(3416)");
console.log("" + f.mod(1).abs()); // 0.(3416)
```

Mathematical correct modulo
---
The behaviour on negative congruences is different to most modulo implementations in computer science. Even the *mod()* function of Fraction.js behaves in the typical way. To solve the problem of having the mathematical correct modulo with Fraction.js you could come up with this:

```javascript
var a = -1
