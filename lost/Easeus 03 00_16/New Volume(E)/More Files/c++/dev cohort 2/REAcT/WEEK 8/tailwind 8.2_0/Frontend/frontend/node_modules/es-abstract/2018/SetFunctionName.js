This event fires after\n * `onKeyPress` and `onCompositionEnd`, but before `onInput`.\n *\n * `beforeInput` is spec'd but not implemented in any browsers, and\n * the `input` event does not provide any useful information about what has\n * actually been added, contrary to the spec. Thus, `textInput` is the best\n * available event to identify the characters that have actually been inserted\n * into the target node.\n *\n * This plugin is also responsible for emitting `composition` events, thus\n * allowing us to share composition fallback code for both `beforeInput` and\n * `composition` event types.\n */\n\n\nfunction extractEvents(dispatchQueue, domEventName, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget, eventSystemFlags, targetContainer) {\n  extractCompositionEvent(dispatchQueue, domEventName, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget);\n  extractBeforeInputEvent(dispatchQueue, domEventName, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget);\n}\n\n/**\n * @see http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/mul
