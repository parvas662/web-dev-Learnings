## Project overview

Sucrase is an alternative to Babel that allows super-fast development builds.
Instead of compiling a large range of JS features to be able to work in Internet
Explorer, Sucrase assumes that you're developing with a recent browser or recent
Node.js version, so it focuses on compiling non-standard language extensions:
JSX, TypeScript, and Flow. Because of this smaller scope, Sucrase can get away
with an architecture that is much more performant but less extensible and
maintainable. Sucrase's parser is forked from Babel's parser (so Sucrase is
indebted to Babel and wouldn't be possible without it) and trims it down to a
focused subset of what Babel solves. If it fits your use case, hopefully Sucrase
can speed up your development experience!

**Sucrase has been extensively tested.** It can successfully build
