d has already been emitted, then the event\n   * is ignored. If the stream is in a paused or non-flowing state, then\n   * the event will be deferred until data flow resumes. If the stream is\n   * async, then handlers will be called on the next tick rather than\n   * immediately.\n   *\n   * If the event is 'close', and 'end' has not yet been emitted, then\n   * the event will be deferred until after 'end' is emitted.\n   *\n   * If the event is 'error', and an AbortSignal was provided for the stream,\n   * and there are no listeners, then the event is ignored, matching the\n   * behavior of node core streams in the presense of an AbortSignal.\n   *\n   * If the event is 'finish' or 'prefinish', then all listeners will be\n   * removed after emitting the event, to prevent double-firing.\n
